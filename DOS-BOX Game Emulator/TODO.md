## Player Input:

anytime:
- Esc      ->   exit program

while in-menu:
- Enter      ->   start new game

while in-game:
- Arr_up     ->   ++paddle_player_y
- Arr_down   ->   --paddle_player_y
- Enter      ->   toggle pause

while out-game/pause & in-game-scored/reset-state:
- Enter      ->   toggle pause

## Game Logic: 

- fix red-scar video bug
- add randomized spawning ball velocity ( do ball_vel_y & ball_vel_x  =  random +1 | -1 )
- refactor code by adding macros if desired

## Music: 

## Package kernel as a .img
